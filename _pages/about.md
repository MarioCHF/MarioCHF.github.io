I'm a graduate in Mathematics at University of Sevilla (US).

I just finished a Master's Degree in Logic, Computation and Artificial Intelligence at University of Sevilla (US), with an average grade of 9.6 out of 10.

I'm interested in developing new AI models, mainly focusing on sustainable AI (such as explainable AI, privacy preserving AI and energy efficient AI) but open to other possible research lines.

Currently looking to pursue a PhD.
