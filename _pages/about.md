👨‍🎓 I'm a **graduate in Mathematics** at University of Sevilla (US).

📚 I just finished a **Master's Degree in Logic, Computation and Artificial Intelligence** at University of Sevilla, with an average grade of 9.6 out of 10.

💡 I'm interested in developing new AI models, mainly focusing on sustainable AI (such as explainable, privacy preserving or energy efficient AI), but open to other possible research lines.

🖊️ Currently looking forward to pursue a PhD.


Selected Experience
======

Open Source Contributions
------
🔐 Developed a new privacy preserving algorithm for my Master's Thesis, using ensemble based federated learning, achieving evaluation metrics that compete with other state of the art models. 

Reimplementing and using AI models
------
🤖 Reimplemented the original transformer architecture proposed in the paper ["Attention is all you need"](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)
 using PyTorch python's library, and used it to perform sentiment analysis as well as to classify a neuromorphic audio dataset. Click [here](https://mariochf.github.io/portfolio/TransformerReimpl) for more details.   

Professional Experience
------
⭐ I'm currently working as a **Research Fellow** at the Microelectronics Institute of Sevilla (IMSE), thanks to CSIC's (Spanish National Research Council) introduction to research scholarship (JAE Intro ICU, AIHUB conexion). 
At this time, my role is to develop new Spiking Neural Network architectures able to **learn synaptic delays** to classify spatio-temporal neuromorphic datasets.
