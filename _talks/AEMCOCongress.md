The rise of artificial intelligence has been accompanied by an explosion in the amount of data, leading to growing concerns about privacy and data management. Federated Learning allows training artificial intelligence models with distributed data, respecting privacy and accessing large volumes of information without exposing sensitive data. This conference talk introduces Federated Learning (FL), gives an example of a novel FL algorithm and highlights possible FL applications to Health and Social Sciences.
