**Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** are emergent models that offer a biologically plausible alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) by computing in terms of discrete spikes (a.k.a. events) instead of real-valued activations. Some advantages of using SNNs are sparsity, efficiency and its natural ability to process time-series. In previous works it has been shown that adding learnable synaptic delays to SNNs improves their ability to learn temporal features, reducing the number of layers and parameters needed. This poster covers a study on the **performance of SNNs using learnable synaptic delays** when used to classify a neuromorphic **spatio-temporal** dataset.
