The goal of this dissertation is to study some geometrical properties of Banach
spaces, mainly uniform convexity and normal structure. First, main Banach spaces
properties are reviewed. Afterwards, we introduce uniform convex spaces. In order to
study the roundness of unit balls in arbitrary Banach spaces, the modulus of convexity
is defined. It will proved that a notable property of uniform convex spaces is the
roundness of its unit balls. Lastly, the modulus of convexity is used to characterize
uniform convex Banach spaces by its two dimensional subspaces.

We continue studying the geometry of Banach spaces introducing Chebyshev elements
and the property of normal structure. Normal structure is more general than
that of uniform convexity, as it will be shown in chapter 3. The importance of normal
structure is seen throughout different kind of results. In particular, we present an
application of normal structure to the metric fixed point theory.

Finally, we work with curves in two dimensional spaces as well as the length of
the circumference of the unit ball in order to introduce a coefficient, 𝑅(𝑋) of Ji Gao.
To introduce 𝑅(𝑋) we proof a result that stands out, which states that the length of
the unit sphere of a 2 dimensional normed space 𝑋 is between 6 and 8.

The importance about 𝑅(𝑋) is that it only depends on the two dimensional subspaces
of our Banach space 𝑋. It will be seen that if 𝑅(𝑋) > 0, then 𝑋 has normal
structure.

In summary, we will visit some geometric properties of Banach spaces, relate them
and give a characterization of them throughout their two dimensional subspaces.
