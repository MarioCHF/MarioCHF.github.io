Neural networks are currently the main players in computation models. Neurons are characterized by their immense number of connections, which, along with their ability to act in parallel, allow us to process all the necessary information. Inspired by these electrical impulses, the computation model presented, Spiking Nuural P systems (SN P systems), was developed.

The SN P systems presented are of two types. In one type, there is no restriction on the amount of "potential" a neuron can contain, resulting in the computational capability of Turing machines (equivalent to 𝑁𝑅𝐸). However, if we limit the content of the neurons, the power of the systems drops drastically, being able to compute only semilinear sets of natural numbers (𝑁𝑅𝐸𝐺).

The review has been developed so that it is mostly self-contained, collecting all the universality results proven in articles [2](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220443792_Spiking_Neural_P_Systems),[1](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0129054106004212). Two new proofs are of particular interest, which have been given to try to complete the results presented in the article, namely Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 3.10.

The review begins with a first chapter illustrating the relationship of our model with biological neurons, also providing some necessary concepts about automata theory and languages. Following this, chapter two formalizes the two computational models used. Finally, in chapter three, all the universality results mentioned in an earlier paragraph (equivalences with 𝑁𝑅𝐸 and 𝑁𝑅𝐸𝐺) are proved.
