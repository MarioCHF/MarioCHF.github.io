This project covers some standard Machine Learning (ML) algorithms such as Categorical Naive Bayes, logistic regression (mini-batch version) and One vs Rest.
The goal of the project is to implement these algoritms and some preprocessing utils needed (for example train_test_split, One Hot encoding and Standard scaler)
from scratch, using only python's numpy library. The implemented algorithms will be used to classify some datasets such as iris, breast_cancer and credits. Check out
the full code in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MarioCHF/MLbasics).
